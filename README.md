## Introduction

This repo contains the code for the go card validator. This uses a pure go implementation of the Luhn algorithm to validate whether the inputted card number is a valid card number. The algorithm used was taken from the GoCardless website and to test this, test card numbers where taken from Stripe, as well as negative tests by incrementing valid test card numbers.

## Features

- Luhn Algorithm

## Future enhancements

- Other algorithms, Damm
- Package clean up
